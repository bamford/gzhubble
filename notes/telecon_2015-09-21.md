### Debiasing and preparing the GZ: Hubble data
*Kyle Willett and Melanie Galloway*

#### What's the basis of the method being used to debias the GZ:HST data?

GZ:HST classifications are being debiased using data from the FERENGI galaxies. The reason that the debiasing methods previously used for GZ1 and GZ2 don't work for these data is the presumed intrinsic evolution of galaxies as a function of redshift. We can't assume as the "ground truth" that the distribution of morphologies at low redshifts (*z*=0.1) is the same at *z*=1-2. Instead, it's assumed that a user's vote fraction for a particular feature changes as a function of redshift, which is modeled as an exponential dropoff set by a single parameter, *ζ*. 

This method assumes:
* that the feature in question (eg, *p_features_or_disk*) **monotonically decreases** for galaxies that appear further away. 
* that the dual effects of changing angular size and apparent magnitude can be subsumed into a single parameter, the *r*-band surface brightness.

*Fig. 1: p_features as a function of redshift for some randomly selected FERENGI galaxies. As expected, p_features drops as simulated distance increases. Since the shapes of the curve aren't uniform, though, we need to fit them for different values of surface brightness.*

#### How we've implemented the debiasing

We compute values for *ζ* using data from all FERENGI galaxies; since there isn't a uniform coverage in redshift-surface brightness space, we can only model the behavior for a subset of the total sample. After getting a value for the set of corrections (essentially a look-up table for how to adjust *p_features* as a function of surface brightness and redshift), we apply the correction to all galaxies in the GZ:HST subset. 

Some galaxies can't be corrected using this method - this occurs for two reasons. First, the FERENGI data shows that there are values of surface brightness and redshift for which we can't distinguish a truly elliptical galaxy from a true spiral galaxy that has low p_features due to the dimness and small size. This occurs when there's a big range of **true** p_features values (eg, between 0.2-0.7) that all map to the same small range of low **measured** *p_features* (eg, 0.1). When the correction isn't single-valued, we don't know what the progenitor was like. The second reason is that the FERENGI galaxies didn't uniformly sample the full range of surface brightness and redshift that we see in the actual Hubble galaxies. In this case, we can compute a correction, but it's just an extrapolation from the data we do have. 

We haven't been able to use this method for any of the GZ morphology vote fractions aside from Task 01 (smooth vs. features/disk). The primary reason is that we had very few FERENGI galaxies with visible features at redshift *z*<0.3, especially for the more specialized category. This means we can't fit a general function to *ζ*. Our proposed solution at the moment is to debias the smooth/feature question, and assume that users' accuracy at identifying **which** features they see is unchanged as long as they do see the features. This is supported (to some extent) by the relatively flat *p_features* debiasing for the deeper questions in the GZ2 data.

#### How many Hubble galaxies can this be applied to? What are their properties?

#### What do we need to still do?

* Find a metric for evaluating whether the correction is doing a reasonable job
* Work through scientific use cases
* Test for any systematic differences between the different surveys in GZH (AEGIS, GEMS, GOODS, COSMOS)
* Compare to other samples of morphology over a similar redshift range, either through expert visual classification or parametric fits
