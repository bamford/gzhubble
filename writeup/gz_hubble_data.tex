\begin{enumerate}
    \item Motivation for studying morphology of galaxies
    \item Particular scientific questions governed by galaxies at $z\sim1$

\end{enumerate}

\section{Sample and Data} 

\subsection{Summary of HST Legacy Survey Imaging}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hubble ACS imaging for the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey \citep[AEGIS;][]{dav07} covers a strip centered at $\alpha=14^\textrm{h}17^\textrm{m}, \delta=+52^\circ30^\prime$. The strip was originally selected due to low extinction and Galactic/zodiacal emission, making it a prime target for multi-wavelength observations by space-based observatories. The ACS images covered 63 separate tiles over a total area of $\sim710$~arcmin$^2$. Images were in two bands, with exposure times of 2300~seconds in F606W (\Vband) and 2100~seconds in F814W (\Iband). The final mosaic images are dithered to a resolution of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. For extended objects, the limiting magnitudes of sources in AEGIS are 26.23~(AB) in \Vband{} and 25.61 (AB) in \Iband. 

\item The Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey \citep[GOODS;][]{gia04} covers two well-studied fields in the northern and southern hemispheres: the Hubble Deep Field-North ($\alpha=12^\textrm{h}36^\textrm{m}, \delta=+62^\circ14^\prime$) and the Chandra Deep Field-South ($\alpha=03^\textrm{h}32^\textrm{m}, \delta=-27^\circ48^\prime$). Data including Hubble ACS images are referred to as GOODS-N and GOODS-S, respectively. ACS imaged the GOODS fields in 4 filters -- F435W (\Bband), \Vband, F775W (\iband), and F850LP (\zband). The mean exposure times for each epoch vary by band, from 1050--2100~seconds. The \Bband{} images were completed in a single epoch at the beginning of the survey, but the \Vband, \iband, and \zband{} images were taken in five separate epochs separated by 40--50~days each. The ACS images are dithered to a pixel scale of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel and covers a total area of $\sim320$~arcmin$^2$ (160~arcmin$^2$ per field). The $5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes for extended sources are 25.7 for \Vband{} and 25.0 for \iband. 

\item The Cosmic Evolution Survey \citep[COSMOS;][]{sco07} covers an area of $\sim1.8$~deg$^2$ centered at $\alpha=10^\textrm{h}00^\textrm{m}28^\textrm{s}, \delta=+02^\circ12^\prime21^{\prime\prime}$. Its location near the celestial equator was designed to enable coverage by ground-based telescopes in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as well as the space-based observatories. The Hubble ACS data from COSMOS consists of 1 orbit with 2028~seconds per pointing in \Iband, consisting of 590 total pointings. The image resolution is dithered to 0.05~\arcsec/pixel. The 50\% completeness magnitude for a galaxy with a half-light radius of $0^{\prime\prime}.50$ in \Iband{} is 24.7 mag. 

\item The Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SEDS \citep[GEMS;][]{rix04,cal08} survey is also centered on the Chandra Deep Field-South. The GEMS data covers $\sim800$~arcmin$^2$, and surrounds the area covered by GOODS-S. Images from ACS in GEMS have 1 orbit per pointing for a total of 63~pointings. The exposure times are 2160 and 2286~seconds in \Vband{} and \zband{}, respectively. The image resolution has a pixel scale of 0.03~\arcsec/pixel. The $5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes for source detection are 25.7 AB in \Vband{} and 24.2~AB in \zband.

\subsection{Image creation}

The GOODS images in GZH use mosaics constructed from both 2-epoch and 5-epoch sets of data. 

The filters that \citet{gri12} uses for the colored images were F606W and F775W for GOODS-N and F606W and F850LP for GOODS-S. 

We use different filters for the north and south GOODS fields so that GEMS can be directly compared with GOODS-S.

\subsection{User weighting}

The votes of individual users who classified galaxies in GZH are combined to make a vote fraction for each question on the classification tree. Users' votes are weighted slightly \citep[in a method identical to that described in][]{wil13} such that users who frequently disagree with all other users end up having very low weights. The majority of users have weights very close to $w=1.0$ ({\bf STEVEN: Is this true for GZH - do you have a plot of the distribution of user weights or consistencies we can include here?}.

\section{Correcting for redshift-dependent classification bias}

The previous versions of Galaxy Zoo morphology classifications \citep{lin08,wil13} were based on observations of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) which are typically at $z<0.1$. In these cases it was assumed that there was no cosmological evolution of the morphologies of galaxies and therefore any observed changes in the distribution of galaxies with different consensus morphologies was due to the effects of redshift on the image quality (\ie. the reduction in physical resolution, surface brightness dimming, etc). For both previous releases of GZ morphologies, we provided a correction for redshift-dependent bias based on matching the classification fractions at the highest redshfts with those at the lowest redshift. See \citet{bam09} and \citet{wil13} for the details. 

In the GZH samples, the redshift range is large enough that we expect to measure cosmological evolution of the types and morphologies of galaxies in the sample. As a result, the previous methods of correcting for redshift dependent bias will not work. In addition, the effects of band shifting will change the images even more across these redshift ranges. %Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFERENGI} illustrates some of the possible effects of losing features in spiral galaxies at high redshift.

%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
 %-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to test and correct for the effects of redshift, we generated a set of calibration images. These images consist of the same galaxy as it would appear over a variety of redshifts. The input images are from the SDSS \citep{yor00,str02} and are processed using the \ferengi{} code \citep{bar08a} to match the observational properties of the HST surveys out to $z=1$. These images were classified in the Galaxy Zoo interface using the same classification scheme as the original HST images.
 
\subsection{Selection of FERENGI input galaxies}

We selected 288 unique galaxies from SDSS imaging to run through the \ferengi{} code. The selection spanned a variety of galaxy morphologies (as selected by GZ2 classifications) and $r^\prime$-band surface brightnesses, and also spanned the redshift range of SDSS targets (in $N_z = 4$ bins) in order to be optimised for different target minimum redshifts in HST imaging. 

The selection criteria for the different morphological categories is summarised in Table \ref{morphologies}. The surface brightness selection ($N_\mu = 3$) was (1) low: $\mu > 21.5$~\magarc;  (2) mid: $20.5 < \mu < 21.5$~\magarc; and (3) high: $\mu < 20.5$~\magarc. For each of the four ``target redshifts'' ($z = 0.3, 0.5, 0.8$ and $1.0$), the images were redshifted in $\Delta z = 0.1$ bins up to $z=1.0$.

\end{table*}

In addition to the physical parameters of the input images, the \ferengi{} output depends on assumptions of the global galaxy evolution model. This evolution is a crude mechanism that mimics the brightness increase of galaxies with increasing redshift (out to at least $z\sim1-2$). The effect on the redshifted images is simply an empirical addition to the magnitude of a galaxy of the form $M' = e\times z + M$, where $M'$ is the corrected magnitude, and $e$ is the evolutionary correction in magnitudes (i.e., $e=-1$ essentially brightens the galaxy by 1~magnitude by $z=1$). We ran \ferengi{} for values of $e$ starting from $e=0$ and decreasing to $e=-3.5$ in increments of $\Delta e = 0.5$. Figure~\ref{fig:exampleFERENGI} shows several examples of the effects of ``losing`` spiral/disc features with increasing redshift for two galaxies with $e=0$. 

The final number of \ferengi{} images produced for each galaxy is ultimately a function of galaxy's redshift, since the new images cannot be resampled at better angular resolution than the original SDSS data, as well as the number of $e$ values selected. Table~\ref{ferengivalues} summarizes the total sample of redshifted images produced for GZH.

\subsection{Correcting GZH morphologies for classification bias}
\label{sec:zeta}

The approach used in GZH for correcting the weighted classifications for user bias rests on the assumption that the \emph{amount} of bias is a function of the apparent size and brightness of the image as seen on screen. This is controlled by two types of parameters: \textbf{intrinsic} properties of the galaxy itself, such as its physical diameter and luminosity, and \textbf{extrinsic} properties, such as the distance (redshift) of the galaxy and its relative orientation. There are likely other parameters that affect user accuracy, such as the proximity of close companions \citep[``distraction bias''; see][]{joh15} or bias as a function of the individual user. The combination of all such parameters forms a high-dimensional space, and we have insufficient data to measure their individual effects. Instead, we use just two parameters that are intended to capture the bulk of the change in bias (based on GZ1/GZ2): a galaxy's $r^\prime$-band surface brightness ($\mu_r$; intrinsic) and redshift ($z$; extrinsic). 

The change in bias as a function of $\mu_r$ and $z$ is measured using the \ferengi{} images over all the evolutionary correction factors. We assume that the ``true'' (ie, debiased) vote fraction $f_{\mu,z}$ for a galaxy can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
f_{\mu,z} = \left(f_{\mu,z=0.3}\right) \times e^{{\frac{z-z_0}{\zeta}}},
\label{eqn:fzeta}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ is the ``calibrated'' vote fraction at the lowest redshift in the \ferengi{} bins ($z=0.3$) and $\zeta$ is a positive parameter that controls the rate at which $f$ decreases with increasing redshift. This formula fits the data relatively well (with almost no exceptions, the vote fractions for featured galaxies decrease monotonically with increasing redshift), and the exponential function bounds the observed vote fractions between $f_{\mu,z=0.3}$ and zero. Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_examples} show examples of the change in vote fraction and their fits to Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta} for a random selection of galaxies in the \ferengi{} images.

\caption{Behavior of the normalized, weighted vote fractions of features visible in a galaxy ($f_\textrm{features}$) as a function of redshift in the artifical \ferengi{} images. Galaxies are a random selection of images with $e=0$ and at least three detectable images in redshift bins of $z\ge0.3$. The measured vote fractions (red points) are fit with an exponential function (Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}); the best-fit parameters are given above each plot. Error bars are Poissonian, assuming a median of 40~votes per galaxy.}
\label{fig:zeta_examples}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

We use the values of $\zeta$ for \emph{all} sets of artifically redshifted galaxies to fit the overall distribution as a function of surface brightness, since we expect the correction being applied to vary as a function of the intrinsic galaxy properties. We restrict the galaxies that can be used to measure the calibration to those with data at the pivot redshift of $z=0.3$, non-zero $f_\textrm{features}$ at $z=0.3$, and with a reasonable fit to the exponential model ($\Delta \chi^2 > 3.0$). 

Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} shows the results of fitting the \ferengi{} images with Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta}; the correction is a weak function of galaxy surface brightness. Higher-surface brightness galaxies have stronger average corrections, likely because these galaxies are more likely to have larger $f_\textrm{features}$ values at high redshifts. Low surface brightness galaxies are more likely to begin low and remain low; the bounded nature of the dropoff (and Poissonian-like variance among the individual voters) means that the average magnitude of $\zeta$ will be less.

\caption{All fits for the vote fraction dropoff parameter $\zeta$ for $f_\textrm{features}$ in the \ferengi{} galaxies as a function of surface brightness.

\label{fig:zeta_mu}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We fit the data in Figure~\ref{fig:zeta_mu} with a linear function such that:

\begin{equation}
\log_{10}(\hat\zeta) = \zeta_0 + \zeta_1 \times \mu,
\label{eqn:zetafit}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\hat\zeta$ is the correction factor applied to each galaxy as a function of surface brightness. The best-fit parameters to the linear fit (from least-squares optimization) are $\zeta_0=0.1$, $\zeta_1=1.4$. To make the final debiased correction, we modify the simple exponential form of Equation~\ref{eqn:fzeta} to bound the debiased vote fractions between $f$ and 1:

\begin{equation}
f_\textrm{features,debiased} = 1 - (1 - f)e^{\frac{z-z_0}{\hat\zeta}}.
\label{eqn:fzeta_mod}
\end{equation}

\label{fig:p_vs_p}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

In Figure~\ref{fig:p_vs_p} we examine the change in $p_{\rm features}$ for the \ferengi{} galaxies relative to their lowest simulated redshift. In this analysis, only galaxies whose lowest simulated redshift image was ($\rm z_{sim}=0.3$) were used (see Table \ref{ferengivalues}), and only those which had detectable surface brightness measurements in \sextractor{}; this includes 3,959 of the total 6,466 images. For each simulated redshift value $z$, and at a fixed surface brightness $\mu$, we plot $p_{\rm features,z}$, the value measured at that simulated redshift, vs $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$, the value measured for the same galaxy imaged at $z=0.3$. 
 
Our objective is to use these data to predict, for a galaxy with a measured $p_{\rm features,z}$ value, what its $p_{\rm features}$ value \emph{would have been} if it had been viewed at $z=0.3$. This predicted value is defined as the debiased vote fraction $p_{\rm features,debiased}$, and is calculated by applying a correction to the measured value of $p_{\rm features}$, determined by the $\zeta$ function described in the previous section. A reliable predicted value can be obtained so long as the relationship between $p_{\rm features,z}$ and $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$ is single-valued; that is, for a given $p_{\rm features,z}$, there is exactly one corresponding value of $p_{\rm features}$ at $z=0.3$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:p_vs_p} shows that the relationship between $p_{\rm features,z}$ and $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$ is \emph{not} always single valued; hence, it is not appropriate to correct galaxies that lie in certain regions of surface brightness/redshift/$p_{\rm features}$ space. These regions tend to have low $p_{\rm features}$ values at high redshift, but a wide range of values at $z=0.3$. These regions contain two morphological types of galaxies: First are genuine ellipticals, which have low values of $p_{\rm features}$ at both high and low redshift. Second are disks whose features become washed out at high redshift; hence their $p_{\rm features}$ value at $z=0.3$ may be quite high, while the value observed at high redshift is very low. This effect is strongest at high $z$ and low $\mu$, where features become nearly impossible to discern in the images.

Our criteria for determining whether a region of this space is single-valued, and therefore correctable, is as follows: In each surface brightness and redshift bin, we model the relationship between $p_{\rm features,z}$ and $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$ by fitting the data with a polynomials of degrees 3, 2, and 1, and use the best fit out of the three. These fits are shown as the dashed black lines in figure ~\ref{fig:p_vs_p}. Any flat regions of the polynomial fits are areas in which there is not a clear single-valued relationship between $p_{\rm features,z}$ and $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$; we quantify this by setting a minimum slope cut of 0.4. Any data in which the polynomial fit has a slope less than this value is considered \emph{not} one-to-one, and therefore ``uncorrectable.'' These regions are highlighted in blue in figure ~\ref{fig:p_vs_p}. Uncolored (white) regions of the plot have sufficiently high slopes for us to consider the relationship to be single-valued; galaxies in these regions are considered ``correctable'', and only these are used in measuring the parameters for the $\zeta$ function (Section \ref{sec:zeta}). Only surface brightness/redshift bins with at least 5 galaxies were considered; regions with fewer than 5 galaxies we consider to have 'not enough information' to determine the  $p_{\rm features,z}$ and $p_{\rm features,z=0.3}$ relationship, these are colored gray in figure ~\ref{fig:p_vs_p}.

The unshaded regions in figure ~\ref{fig:p_vs_p} define discrete ranges of redshift, surface brightness, and $\pfeatures$ a galaxy must have in order for the $\zeta$ approach to be confidentely applied to a galaxy in the GZH sample. While the appropriate correctable regions were defined discretely, we assume the true correctable region is a smooth function of z, $\mu$, and $\pfeatures$. To define this smooth space, we use a convex hull method to enclose the correctable and uncorrectable \ferengi{} galaxies is z-$\mu$-$\pfeatures$ space. Due to scatter, the boundaries of the resulting hulls overlap. The boundaries are then adjusted until the contamination from both groups is minimized. We use the resulting hulls to define the correctable and uncorrectable regions for categorizing the Hubble galaxies. The results of this method and final categorization of the Hubble sample is displayed in Table~\ref{hubble_debiasable}. We find that of the galaxies at redshift higher than $z=z_{0}=0.3$, 17\% of these are able to be debiased using the $\zeta$ method, 27\% cannot be debiased, and 56\% cannot be determined, due to a lack of redshift or information or due to a lack of \ferengi{} data corresponding to those galaxies redshift/surface brightness values.

now talk about how we get low/high limits on pfeatures

    \item Tasca (COSMOS)
    \item Cassata (COSMOS)
    \item Zajmoski (COSMOS)
