Example images of the 288 input SDSS galaxies (72 per minimum redshift * 4 minimum redshift) for 7 different questions on the tree (there are two sets for the bar question). 

Here are the selection criteria for the categories

1. Features (Q1): Clean Yes, Int, Clean No: 
No: p_smooth > 0.8
Int: 0.3 < p_smooth < 0.6
Yes: p_features_or_disk > 0.8. 
To make sure they're not mergers, I also suggest requiring p_odd < 0.1

2. Mergers: Clean No, Int, Clean Yes (3 galaxies - some overlap with above)
No: p_features_or_disk > 0.8 & p_odd < 0.1 & p_merger < 0.1
Int: p_odd > 0.5 & 0.1< p_merger < 0.4 
Yes: p_odd > 0.5 & p_merger > 0.4

3. Edge-on: clean no, int, clean yes
Yes: p_edgeon > 0.8
Int: 0.4 < p_edgeon < 0.8
No: p_edgeon < 0.2
Also require p_features_or_disk > 0.5
 
4. Bars (from clean no edge-on sample): clean no, int, clean yes
No: p_bar < 0.1
Int: 0.2 < p_bar < 0.4
Yes: p_bar > 0.8
Also require p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon < 0.2
This category is run twice. 

5. Spirals (clean not edge-on, and bar-less): clean no, int, clean yes
No: p_spiral < 0.2
Int: 0.2 < p_spiral < 0.8
Yes: p_spiral > 0.8
Also require p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon < 0.2 and p_bar < 0.1

6. Bulges (clean not edge-on, and bar-less): 
No: p_nobulge>0.6
Int: p_justnoticeable>0.6
Yes: p_obvious/dominent>0.5 * ask Edmond what this means p_ob+p_dom>0.5 or p_ob OR p_dom >0.5
Also require p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon < 0.5 and p_bar < 0.2

7. Edge-on bulge shape: 
Round: p_rounded>0.5, p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon > 0.5
Boxy: p_boxy>0.4, p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon > 0.2
Non: p_nobulge>0.5, p_features_or_disk > 0.5 and p_edgeon > 0.5

Input galaxies are done at three surface brightnesses: 

mu > 21.5 (low)
20.5 < mu < 21.5 (mid)
mu < 20.5 (high)

In the example each input galaxies has been FERENGI'd just once to each galaxy's minimum redshift and with no evolution (evo=0.0). 

In the full set the input galaxies are FERENGI'd

Target z=0.3: Nredshift=8; Nevolution = 7, Ntotal = 56 (per input galaxy)
Target z=0.5: Nredshift=6; Nevolution = 4, Ntotal = 24 (per input galaxy)
Target z=0.8: Nredshift=3; Nevolution = 3, Ntotal = 9 (per input galaxy)
Target z=1.0: Nredshift=1; Nevolution = 3, Ntotal = 3 (per input galaxy)
 

At the bottom of each page, the following information is displayed - GZ2 category, minimum redshift, surface brightness bin, and evolution.

Comment: 
Seemingly an edge-on galaxy in faceonbulge sample?
SDSS objid = 588017979437875205 (z=0.3 mid, no evolution)
"This is the only galaxy that fits the requirements for this subclass, so there is no other choice. We can either keep it or just discard it, but I don't think we need to discard it, this galaxy shouldn't be detrimental to our ultimate goal. "
