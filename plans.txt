Summary of GZH Surveys

AEGIS has1 orbit each (~2200 seconds) in F606W (V band) and F814W filter and has been dithered to 0.03 ''/pixel; the imaging covers ~710 arcmin^2.

GOODS targeted 2 fields, GOODS-N and GOODS-S, imaging in 4 filters -- F435W (B), F606W (V), F775W (i), and F850LP (z). The mean exposure times vary, from 1000 - 2100 seconds. The images have been dithered to a pixel scale of 0.03 ''/pixel and covers at total area of ~320 arcmin^2 (160 arcmin^2 per field). The filters that Griffith et al uses for the colored images were F606W and F775W for GOODS-N and F606W and F850LP for GOODS-S.

COSMOS has 1 orbit (2028 seconds) in the F814W (I band) filter and has been dithered to 0.05 ''/pixel; it covers the largest area, ~1.8 deg^2. 

GEMS has 1 orbit (2160 and 2286 seconds) in the F606W and F850LP filters, with a pixel scale of 0.03 ''/pixel; it covers ~800 arcmin^2

There are 8 Galaxy Zoo 2 categories, seven we agreed to - mergers, spirals, face-on bulge, edge-on bulge, edge-on, features, and bars - and an additional one that I am including that simply includes more bars at different p_bars, I called it 'more bar'. 

Within each category, there are 3 different classifications. 

Also, each category has 3 surface brightness bins. 

That's 72 galaxies per minimum redshift, or as I've been calling it, target redshifts, meaning that I am using a different set of input SDSS galaxies for each minimum redshift that we choose. 

I've chosen 4 minimum redshifts - 0.30, 0.50, 0.80, and 1.0. Moreover, for each set of input SDSS galaxies, I do the following:

For each galaxy, I FERENGI in redshift intervals of 0.10, up to z=1.0. 

For each redshift that I FERENGI, I will also FERENGI different evolution terms, depending on the target redshift. 

The evolution in FERENGI is an empirical addition to the magnitude of a galaxy like this: M' = evo*z + M, where M': the corrected magnitude, evo: evolutionary correction in magnitudes, z: redshift, M: uncorrected magnitude, i.e. evo=-1 essentially brightens the galaxy by 1 magnitude at redshift z=1.
